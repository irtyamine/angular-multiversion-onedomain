<h3>Angular multi-version single domain</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates how to deploy multiple angular apps on different <strong>Docker</strong> containers using the same domain. The apps are developed on different angular versions and every uri you type, will redirect to the specific server through <strong>Nginx HTTP Proxying</strong>.</p>
<p>The project is composed of two apps: <strong>angularjs_demo</strong> developed in angular <strong>version 1.6</strong> and <strong>angular6_demo</strong> developed on angular <strong>version 6</strong>.</p>
<p>This project is usefull in the case you want to convert monolithic AngularJS apps to modules progressively without to stop the current development of new functionality or bug fixing. Every new module migrated to angular 6 will replace the old one developed in angularjs.</p>

<p>In the <strong>angular6_demo</strong> app, there is a Route guard that redirect to <strong>angularjs</strong> app those requests not implemented yet, avoiding the router manage the uri internally. In the <strong>angularjs_demo</strong> app, when you click in a menu belong to a module already migrated to angular 6, the page will be redirected to the <strong>angular6_demo</strong> page.</p>
